# PLANT_LEAF_DISEASE_DETECTOR

This is a real life problem-based project that can be used for agricultural purpose. This project is based on the image classification technique. Covolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used in this project.
The model is trained with different pictures of leaves suffering from various diseases. The model will then be compared with normal leaf pictures.
